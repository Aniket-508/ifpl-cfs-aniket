# Shankh.ai - Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue #1: Whisper Speech Transcription

**Status:** Fixed

- Whisper is already running in the RAG service (loaded on startup)
- The RAG service transcribe endpoint is available at http://localhost:8000/transcribe
- Backend is configured to use it via RAG_SERVICE_URL

**How to test:**

1. Click the microphone button
2. Speak clearly for 3-5 seconds
3. Click stop
4. Your speech should be transcribed and appear in the chat

**Troubleshooting:**

- Check RAG service console - should show "✓ Whisper model loaded"
- If transcription fails, check backend console for error messages
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted in browser

### ✅ Issue #2: Duplicate Messages

**Status:** Fixed
**Root Cause:** Messages were being added twice:

1. Once from the HTTP API response
2. Again from the WebSocket message event

**Solution:** Removed duplicate message addition in:

- `handleSendText()` - Now only sends via API, WebSocket handles response
- `handleStopRecording()` - Same fix for audio messages

**What changed:**

- Messages now only come through WebSocket
- This ensures real-time updates and prevents duplicates
- Loading state properly managed

### ✅ Issue #3: Audio Playback Not Working

**Status:** Fixed
**Root Cause:** Audio URLs were relative paths (e.g., `/audio/xyz.mp3`) but Audio API needs absolute URLs

**Solution:**

- Updated `handlePlayAudio()` to convert relative URLs to absolute
- Added error handling for playback failures
- Now constructs full URL: `http://localhost:4000/audio/xyz.mp3`

**Requirements:**

- ffmpeg must be installed (✅ Confirmed installed)
- Backend must have write access to `./audio` directory
- TTS_PROVIDER must be set (currently: gtts)

## RAG-Specific Test Questions

To verify RAG is working (pulling from your PDFs), ask these:

### English Questions:

1. "What is the minimum balance requirement for a savings account?"
2. "What documents are required to open a bank account?"
3. "What are the interest rates for fixed deposits?"
4. "Explain the loan application process step by step"
5. "What are the eligibility criteria for a home loan?"
6. "What is the procedure for account closure?"
7. "What are the different types of loans available?"
8. "What are the charges for ATM transactions?"

### Hindi Questions:

1. "बचत खाते के लिए न्यूनतम शेष राशि क्या है?"
2. "खाता खोलने के लिए कौन से दस्तावेज़ चाहिए?"
3. "ऋण आवेदन प्रक्रिया क्या है?"

### How to Verify RAG is Working:

1. **Check for citations:** Look for "Sources:" section below the response
2. **Verify filename:** Should show "149[1].pdf" or "151.pdf"
3. **Check page numbers:** Should reference specific pages
4. **Excerpt matches:** The excerpt should contain text from the PDF

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the frontend** (it should auto-reload with the fixes)
2. **Test text input** first to verify duplicate fix
3. **Test voice input** to verify Whisper transcription
4. **Test audio playback** by clicking the speaker icon
5. **Try RAG questions** from the list above to verify PDF retrieval

## Console Checks

### RAG Service (port 8000):

```
✓ Model loaded (dim: 768)
✓ Loaded index with 3734 vectors
✓ Whisper model loaded
```

### Backend (port 4000):

```
Server running on port 4000
✓ Connected to RAG service
```

### Frontend (port 5173):

```
[WS] Connected
[WS] Joined session: <uuid>
```

## Environment Variables to Verify

In `packages/backend/.env`:

- `RAG_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000` ✅
- `STT_PROVIDER=whisper` ✅
- `TTS_PROVIDER=gtts` ✅
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>` ✅

## Known Limitations

1. **Audio quality:** gTTS is free but voices sound robotic
   - Upgrade to Azure TTS or ElevenLabs for better quality
2. **Transcription accuracy:** Whisper base model is fast but less accurate
   - Upgrade to `medium` or `large` model for better accuracy
3. **Response time:** First response may be slow (model loading)
   - Subsequent responses should be faster

## Files Modified

1. `packages/frontend/src/App.jsx`

   - Fixed duplicate messages (removed API response handlers)
   - Fixed audio playback (absolute URL conversion)
   - Added error handling for audio playback

2. `packages/frontend/package.json`

   - Added `uuid` dependency

3. `packages/rag_service/.env`

   - Added INDEX_PATH configuration

4. `packages/backend/.env`

   - Copied from root .env

5. `packages/frontend/.env`
   - Copied from root .env
